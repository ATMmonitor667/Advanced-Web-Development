## ✍️ Example Completed README Section

### Description and Purpose
> TaskMaster is a productivity app designed for college students to manage their academic workload across multiple courses. Students can create tasks, organize them by course, set priorities, and track completion. The app helps students stay on top of deadlines and reduce academic stress through better organization.

### Inspiration
> As college students ourselves, we noticed that keeping track of assignments across 4-5 different courses can be overwhelming. Existing task apps are either too simple or too complex for academic needs. We wanted to create something specifically designed for the student workflow, with features like course-based organization and priority levels. Our goal is to help students feel more in control of their workload.

### Features
- [ ] **Create Tasks** - Add new tasks with title, description, due date, and course
- [ ] **View All Tasks** - See a complete list of tasks in an organized dashboard
- [ ] **Edit Tasks** - Update task details, change due dates, or modify priorities
- [ ] **Delete Tasks** - Remove completed or unnecessary tasks
- [ ] **Course Organization** - Organize tasks by course (one-to-many relationship)
- [ ] **Task Tags** - Add multiple tags to tasks for better categorization (many-to-many)
- [ ] **Filter by Course** - View tasks for a specific course only (Custom Feature)
- [ ] **Auto-Welcome Tasks** - New users get starter tasks automatically (Custom Feature)
