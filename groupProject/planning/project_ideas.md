## Tips for Choosing Your Project

✅ **Choose something you're passionate about** - You'll be working on this for several weeks!

✅ **Keep it realistic** - Make sure you can implement all baseline features in the time available

✅ **Think about relationships** - Your app needs one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Plan these early!

✅ **Plan for CRUD** - Your main entity needs Create, Read, Update, Delete operations

✅ **Consider your custom features** - Pick 2 custom features that make sense for your app

✅ **Don't overcomplicate** - Start simple, you can always add stretch features later
