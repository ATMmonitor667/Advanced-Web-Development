## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[Write your response here. Reflect on what you and your partner did well in completing Milestone 1.]

**Example:**
> We had great collaboration and quickly agreed on an app idea that we're both excited about. We were able to brainstorm user stories together and came up with creative features that go beyond the baseline requirements. Our communication has been smooth, and we've established a good workflow for working together.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[Write your response here. Describe any difficulties you encountered while planning your project.]

**Example:**
> One challenge was narrowing down our feature list. We had many ideas but needed to prioritize which features were essential for the MVP (minimum viable product) versus which could be stretch goals. We also spent time understanding the database relationship requirements and making sure our app idea would incorporate one-to-many and many-to-many relationships naturally.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[Write your response here. What help or resources do you anticipate needing?]

**Example:**
> We'll need guidance on designing the database schema to properly implement the many-to-many relationship with a join table. We're also not entirely confident about deploying to Render yet, so we'll need to review deployment documentation. Additionally, we want to make sure we're following best practices for organizing our React components, so we may need to review component hierarchy examples.
