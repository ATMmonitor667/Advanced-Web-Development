## üìù Description and Purpose

[Describe your app in 2-3 sentences. What does it do? Who is it for?]

**Example:**
> Our app is a task management platform designed for college students to organize their assignments, projects, and study schedules. Students can create custom task lists, set priorities, track deadlines, and earn rewards for completing tasks on time.

## üé® Inspiration

[Explain what inspired you to build this app. What problem does it solve? Why did you choose this topic?]

**Example:**
> We were inspired to create this app because we noticed that many students struggle to keep track of multiple deadlines across different classes. Existing task apps are often too complex or don't cater to the academic workflow. We wanted to build something simple, student-focused, and motivating.
